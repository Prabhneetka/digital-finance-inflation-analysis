# digital-finance-inflation-analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project conducts an empirical macro-financial analysis to study the relationship between inflation, economic growth, and private sector credit in major European economies. Using official World Bank data and R, the project demonstrates applied skills in data cleaning, transformation, and econometric modeling, aligned with modern digital finance and financial economics practices.

The analysis focuses on understanding how real economic activity and financial deepening influence inflation outcomes—an issue central to monetary policy, financial stability, and digital-era economic governance.
